hba1c	1	1.0954	10	Use methods to measure HbA1c that have been calibrated according to International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) standardisation.	Investigate unexplained discrepancies between HbA1c and other glucose measurements.	Involve adults with type 2 diabetes in decisions about their individual HbA1c target.	For adults with type 2 diabetes managed either by lifestyle and diet, or by lifestyle and diet combined with a single drug not associated with hypoglycaemia, support the person to aim for an HbA1c level of 48 mmol mol(6.5percent).	For adults on a drug associated with hypoglycaemia, support the person to aim for an HbA1c level of 53 mmol mol (7.0percent).	In adults with type 2 diabetes, if HbA1c levels are not adequately controlled by a single drug and rise to 58 mmol mol (7.5percent) or higher: reinforce advice about diet, lifestyle and adherence to drug treatment and support the person to aim for an HbA1c level of 53 mmol mol (7.0percent) and intensify drug treatment.	If adults with type 2 diabetes achieve an HbA1c level that is lower than their target and they are not experiencing hypoglycaemia, encourage them to maintain it.	Be aware that there are other possible reasons for a low HbA1c level, for example, deteriorating renal function or sudden weight loss.	If adults with type 2 diabetes achieve an HbA1c level that is lower than their target and they are not experiencing hypoglycaemia, encourage them to maintain it.	Be aware that there are other possible reasons for a low HbA1c level, for example, deteriorating renal function or sudden weight loss.	
pressure	0	1.0941	8	Measure blood pressure at least annually in an adult with type 2 diabetes without previously diagnosed hypertension or renal disease.	For an adult with type 2 diabetes on antihypertensive drug treatment when diabetes is diagnosed, review blood pressure control and medications used.	Add medications if lifestyle advice does not reduce blood pressure to below 140 80 mmHg (below 130 80 mmHg if there is kidney, eye or cerebrovascular damage).	Monitor blood pressure every 1–2 months, and intensify therapy if the person is already on antihypertensive drug treatment, until the blood pressure is consistently below 140 80 mmHg (below 130 80 mmHg if there is kidney, eye or cerebrovascular damage).	If the person's blood pressure is not reduced to the individually agreed target with first-line therapy, add a calcium-channel blocker or a diuretic (usually a thiazide or thiazide-related diuretic).	If the person's blood pressure is not reduced to the individually agreed target with triple therapy, add an alpha-blocker, a beta-blocker or a potassium-sparing diuretic (the last with caution if the person is already taking an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II-receptor antagonist).	Monitor the blood pressure of a person who has attained and consistently remained at his or her blood pressure target every 4–6 months.	Check for possible adverse effects of antihypertensive drug treatment – including the risks from unnecessarily low blood pressure.	
time	0	1.0936	3	Offer structured education to adults with type 2 diabetes and or their family members or carers (as appropriate) at and around the time of diagnosis, with annual reinforcement and review.

hypoglycaemia	0	1.0869	9	Reducing the risk of hypoglycaemia should be a particular aim for a person using insulin or an insulin secretagogue.

For adults with type 2 diabetes managed either by lifestyle and diet, or by lifestyle and diet combined with a single drug not associated with hypoglycaemia, support the person to aim for an HbA1c level of 48 mmol mol(6.5percent).	For adults on a drug associated with hypoglycaemia, support the person to aim for an HbA1c level of 53 mmol mol (7.0percent).	If adults with type 2 diabetes achieve an HbA1c level that is lower than their target and they are not experiencing hypoglycaemia, encourage them to maintain it.	If adults with type 2 diabetes achieve an HbA1c level that is lower than their target and they are not experiencing hypoglycaemia, encourage them to maintain it.	Do not routinely offer self-monitoring of blood glucose levels for adults with type 2 diabetes unless: the person is on insulin or there is evidence of hypoglycaemic episodes or the person is on oral medication that may increase their risk of hypoglycaemia while driving or operating machinery or the person is pregnant, or is planning to become pregnant.	Consider short-term self-monitoring of blood glucose levels in adults with type 2 diabetes (and review treatment as necessary): when starting treatment with oral or intravenous corticosteroids or to confirm suspected hypoglycaemia.
