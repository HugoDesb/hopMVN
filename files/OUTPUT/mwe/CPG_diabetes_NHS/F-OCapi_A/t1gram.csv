Prescribe metformin with caution for those at risk of a sudden deterioration in kidney function and those at risk of eGFR falling below 45 ml minute 3m2. 3 In adults with type 2 diabetes, if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated, consider initial drug treatment with: a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor or pioglitazone or a sulfonylurea. 4 In adults with type 2 diabetes, do not offer or continue pioglitazone if they have any of the following: heart failure or history of heart failure	Treatment with sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors , may be appropriate for some adults with type 2 diabetes if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated (see NICE's guidance on canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin as monotherapies for treating type 2 diabetes).	First intensification of drug treatment 5 In adults with type 2 diabetes, if initial drug treatment with metformin has not continued to control HbA1c to below the person's individually agreed threshold for intensification, consider dual therapy with: metformin and a DPP-4 inhibitor or metformin and pioglitazone or metformin and a sulfonylurea. 6 In adults with type 2 diabetes, if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated and initial drug treatment has not continued to control HbA1c to below the person's individually agreed threshold for intensification, consider dual therapy with: a DPP-4 inhibitor and pioglitazone or a DPP-4 inhibitor and a sulfonylurea or pioglitazone and a sulfonylurea.	Second intensification of drug treatment 7 In adults with type 2 diabetes, if dual therapy with metformin and another oral drug (see recommendation 5) has not continued to control HbA1c to below the person's individually agreed threshold for intensification, consider either: triple therapy with: metformin, a DPP-4 inhibitor and a sulfonylurea or metformin, pioglitazone and a sulfonylurea or starting insulin-based treatment (see recommendations 2– 4). 8 If triple therapy with metformin and 2 other oral drugs (see recommendation 7) is not effective, not tolerated or contraindicated, consider combination therapy with metformin, a sulfonylurea and a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) mimetic for adults with type 2 diabetes who: have a BMI of 35 kg m2 or higher (adjust accordingly for people from black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups) and specific psychological or other medical problems associated with obesity or have a BMI lower than 35 kg m2and: for whom insulin therapy would have significant occupational implications or weight loss would benefit other significant obesity-related comorbidities. 9 Only continue GLP-1 mimetic therapy if the person with type 2 diabetes has had a beneficial metabolic response (a reduction of at least 11 mmol mol  percent in	HbA1c and a weight loss of at least 3percent of initial body weight in 6 months). 0 In adults with type 2 diabetes, if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated, and if dual therapy with 2 oral drugs (see recommendation 6) has not continued to control HbA1c to below the person's individually agreed threshold for intensification, consider insulin-based treatment (see recommendations 2– 4).	Insulin-based treatments 2 When starting insulin therapy in adults with type 2 diabetes, use a structured programme employing active insulin dose titration that encompasses: injection technique, including rotating injection sites and avoiding repeated injections at the same point within sites continuing telephone support self-monitoring dose titration to target levels dietary understanding	For treating vomiting caused by gastroparesis in adults with type 2 diabetes: consider alternating use of erythomycin and metoclopramide consider domperidone only in exceptional circumstances (if domperidone is the only effective treatment) and in accordance with MHRA guidance.	When using tricyclic drugs and antihypertensive drug treatments in adults with type 2 diabetes who have autonomic neuropathy, be aware of the increased likelihood of side effects such as orthostatic hypotension.	Erectile dysfunction 3 Offer men with type 2 diabetes the opportunity to discuss erectile dysfunction as part of their annual review. 4 Assess, educate and support men with type 2 diabetes who have problematic erectile dysfunction, addressing contributory factors such as cardiovascular disease as well as possible treatment options. 5 Consider a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor to treat problematic erectile dysfunction in men with type 2 diabetes, initially choosing the drug with the lowest acquisition cost and taking into account any contraindications. 6 Following discussion, refer men with type 2 diabetes to a service offering other medical, surgical or psychological management of erectile dysfunction if treatment (including a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, as appropriate) has been unsuccessful.	Known risk factors for these conditions, including increased age, should be carefully evaluated before treatment: see the manufacturers' summaries of product characteristics for details	Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) guidance (2011) advises that 'prescribers should review the safety and efficacy of pioglitazone in individuals after 3–6 months of treatment to ensure that only patients who are deriving benefit continue to be treated'.
